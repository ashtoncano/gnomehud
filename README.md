# GNOME HUD (WIP)

GNOME Shell extension for displaying system information like CPU usage, RAM usage, GPU usage, and FPS.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`
2. Rename the repository's folder to `gnomehud@ashtonn.com`
3. Restart the GNOME Shell with `Alt` + `F2`, `r`, then `Enter`. Alternatively, log out or restart the computer
4. If the extension isn't already enabled, use `gnome-extensions enable gnomehud@ashtonn.com`

*If the extension does not appear, make sure you have user extensions enabled with `gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-user-extensions false`*
